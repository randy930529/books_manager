## Setting

First, config enviroment for Apollo GraphQL server:

`uri> apollo server`
HOST_GRAPHQL_SERVER=
```

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

From your command line via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Apollo server

Run the development apollo server.

```bash
npm run server
```

You should now see the following output at the bottom of your terminal:

```bash

```

To execute our first query, we can use Apollo Sandbox.

Visit <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, which will open the Apollo Sandbox.

Run the Nextjs App:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
